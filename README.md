# Simulating-the-Motion-of-a-non-linear-pendulum-
I Simulated the Motion of a non-linear pendulum and compared it with the linear one under the condition such that the initial velocity of pendulum is 0 and g = 9.8 m/s2. I used Central finite difference method using taylor expansion of the simulation.
